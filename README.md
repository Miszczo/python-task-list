# python-task-list

To run this file i have used pycharm console with interpreter from Anaconda distribution, but you can run this code with some online interpreters and it works too.

-When you run this script you can choose an option 1, 2 or 3. 1 is for adding new elements to list, 2 is for display list and 3 is for cleaning all list.
-If you did a task and you want to execute another then you need to run again the script.
-Add: when you add the element to the CSV list it will be added to the end of the list.
-Show list: when you use a 2 number the console will display your list.
- Delete: with 3 number you can erase elements from the list
